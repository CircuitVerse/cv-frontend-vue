# Issue & PR Label Guide

This document defines the labeling system used for issues and pull requests in the **cv-frontend-vue** repository.  
The goal is to ensure consistent triaging, improve issue clarity, and make it easier for contributors and maintainers to collaborate effectively.

Labels are applied after verifying reproducibility, checking for duplicates, and ensuring each issue addresses a single concern. Issues covering multiple concerns may be split for clarity.
